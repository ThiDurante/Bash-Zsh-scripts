<summary>Automate commits with GC "message", no need for 3 commands anymore :)

```bash
# open .zshrc or bashrc
code ~/.zshrc
# go to the end of the file, add the script
# save the file
# now lets use it as a reference
source ~/.zshrc
#use GC to add ., commit and push!
# remember to pass a message with GC "message"
```
